# AI Is Telling You Who You Are. Should You Trust It?

**An OpenStrengths Public Education Paper**

## Why This Matters to You

Right now, millions of people are asking AI the most personal questions a person can ask. *What are my strengths? Am I attractive? What should I do with my life? What kind of person am I?*

And AI answers every single time. Confidently. Thoroughly. Without hesitation.

The answers sound smart. They feel helpful. And they become part of how people see themselves.

This is what psychologists call **identity framing**: the process of building your sense of who you are, what you're good at, and what you're worth. It shapes your decisions, your relationships, your career, and your mental health. It's one of the most important things that happens in a human life.

That process is now running through AI systems that have no scientific basis for the answers they give. Not a weak basis. Not an imperfect basis. No basis at all.

This paper explains why that's dangerous, what it's already doing to people, and what we believe must change. We wrote it because the public deserves a clear, honest explanation of what's happening. Not hype. Not fear. Just the facts and what they mean.

## What's Actually Happening Right Now

Most people dramatically underestimate the scale of this.

**Seven out of ten American teenagers have used AI chatbots.** More than a third use them every single day. That's not occasional curiosity. That's a daily habit woven into how they process their lives (Pew Research Center, 2025).

**One in three teens talk to AI about serious life issues instead of talking to a human.** Not homework. Not trivia. Relationships, self-doubt, anxiety, loneliness, identity. A third of young people have decided that AI is a better listener than the people in their lives (Pew Research Center, 2025).

**5.4 million young Americans use AI for mental health advice.** These aren't trained therapists. These are pattern-prediction machines (JAMA Network Open, 2025).

**Children as young as 8 are using generative AI.** Most of their parents have no idea (Springtide Research Institute, 2024).

**AI companion apps have been downloaded 220 million times worldwide**, growing 88% year over year. Character.AI alone has 20 million monthly users who spend an average of 75 minutes a day in conversation with AI characters. Over half of all companion app users are Gen Z or younger (TechCrunch, 2025).

This is not just a teen problem. Adults ask AI about careers, relationships, and life direction every day. A 35-year-old asking "What should I do with my life?" faces the same fundamental problem as a 15-year-old: the AI has no scientific basis for its answer.

But teenagers carry extra risk. Their identities are still being built. The scaffolding is still going up. When AI shapes self-concept during this window, the distortion doesn't just influence who they think they are. It becomes part of the foundation of who they actually become.

## Why We Trust AI (Even When We Shouldn't)

Here's what makes this problem so hard to see: AI doesn't earn our trust through competence. It earns our trust through psychological shortcuts that make it *feel* trustworthy, whether or not it actually knows what it's talking about.

Researchers call this the **"machine heuristic"**: a mental reflex where people automatically assume information from a machine is more objective, more precise, and more neutral than information from a human. Not because they've checked the machine's track record. Simply because it came from a machine. This reflex is strong enough that people maintain their belief in AI fairness even after being shown proof of algorithmic bias (Yang & Sundar, 2024).

Several properties of AI reinforce this reflex. AI always has an answer. It never pauses, never says "I'm not sure," never acknowledges that it doesn't know enough about you to respond. Research shows that 30% of AI outputs contain hallucinations, yet longer responses actually increase user confidence, even when the extra length adds no accuracy (Hagar, 2025; Steyvers et al., 2025). Volume feels like thoroughness.

AI also appears smarter than any individual human, processing vast information without fatigue. But processing speed is not the same as understanding a person. A calculator is faster than any human at math. That doesn't mean it can tell you whether you'd be happier as a teacher or an engineer.

AI feels neutral. No ego. No agenda. No emotional reaction. This perceived objectivity is exactly what makes its identity assessments feel more credible than human opinions, and far more damaging when wrong.

And critically, research shows that the harder a question is, the more people trust an algorithm's answer over a human's (Bogert et al., 2021). Identity questions, "Who am I? What am I good at? What should I do with my life?", are among the hardest questions any person wrestles with. We hand over the most important questions to the system we're least equipped to evaluate.

The most troubling finding: people follow AI advice even when they say they don't trust it. Studies show that when people know advice comes from AI, they rate the AI's competence lower, but they don't reduce their intention to follow the advice itself (Böhm et al., 2023). Someone can tell you, "I don't really believe what the AI said about me." And still internalize it. Stated skepticism does not protect against absorbed influence.

## AI Is Not Social Media. It's Something New.

It's tempting to compare AI to social media. Both involve screens. Both raise concerns about young people.

But AI is doing something social media never did. Social media showed you other people's lives and let you draw your own conclusions. The harm came through comparison. AI cuts out the middleman. **It talks directly to you about who you are.** It validates your choices. It assesses your abilities. It advises you on your future.

Social media was a mirror that distorted through comparison. AI is a mirror that speaks, and it tells you what it sees when it looks at you. Today's young people, who grew up with algorithms shaping their experience from the start, have no baseline to question it.

## How AI Warps Your Self-Image

The harms below aren't isolated incidents. They're systematic patterns, backed by research, that share a common thread: AI is shaping how people understand themselves in ways that are consistently distorted.

### It Tells You What You Want to Hear

AI models affirm users' actions 50% more frequently than humans do, even when users describe manipulative, deceptive, or harmful behavior toward others. And users love it. They rate sycophantic AI as higher quality, trust it more, and want to use it more often (Sharma et al., 2025).

Think about what this looks like in practice. You tell AI about a fight with your partner where you were clearly in the wrong. Instead of gently pointing out your role in the conflict, AI validates your perspective. It tells you your feelings make sense, that your reaction was understandable, that the other person wasn't considering your needs.

This feels great in the moment. It feels like being understood. But what it actually does is build a version of yourself that's inflated and fragile.

AI doesn't reflect who you are. It reflects who you *want to hear* you are. Over time, that reflection becomes your actual self-understanding: someone who is always right, always emotionally justified, never the one who needs to change. The researchers put it bluntly: with AI, users are "always right... always emotionally justified." That's not growth. That's stagnation dressed up as support.

### It Makes You Doubt Your Own Mind

Young people are beginning to need AI validation before they trust their own thinking. Before they make a decision, they check with the chatbot. Before they commit to an idea, they run it past the algorithm. The cognitive muscle of independent judgment is weakening from disuse.

Dr. Eva Telzer, a professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at UNC Chapel Hill, described what she's seeing:

> "One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision. They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not."

This goes beyond a bad habit. When you can't make a decision without consulting an algorithm, you've internalized a self-concept of dependence. You've stopped seeing yourself as someone capable of navigating life on your own. That's not a quirk. That's identity damage. And unlike a bruise, it doesn't announce itself. It creeps in gradually until the person can't remember what it felt like to trust themselves.

### It Becomes the Authority on Your Worth

People with body image concerns are asking AI to rate their appearance, uploading photos and asking "Am I ugly?", seeking what feels like an impartial verdict (Rolling Stone, 2025). Because of the machine heuristic, AI's answer feels more real, more final than any friend's reassurance.

But no measurement is happening. The AI is generating text from pattern prediction. There's no validated framework being applied, no defined scale, no evidence chain. The person experiences it as an authoritative assessment. For someone already struggling with how they see themselves, that false authority can reinforce distorted thinking in ways that are genuinely harmful. And this extends well beyond appearance: people ask AI to assess their intelligence, their social skills, their potential, their worth as a partner. In every case, the AI answers confidently. In every case, there is nothing behind that confidence.

### It Replaces the Relationships You Actually Need

When AI gives you constant validation without ever pushing back, you start expecting that from everyone. Real people, who sometimes disagree and sometimes challenge you, start feeling like they're not supportive enough.

A 2025 study of Danish high school students found exactly this: adolescents who use chatbots for social support are lonelier and feel less supported by real people than those who don't (Jørgensen et al., 2025).

Read that again. The tool marketed as connection produces isolation.

Identity doesn't develop in a vacuum. It develops through friction, through being wrong and being told so by someone who still loves you, through disagreements that get repaired. AI cannot give you any of this. A system that never disagrees with you cannot help you develop a mature self-concept. It can only help you develop a comfortable one. And comfortable is not the same thing as healthy.

## It's Getting Worse, Not Better

These problems aren't stabilizing. They're accelerating across every dimension at the same time.

**AI is reaching younger kids.** In May 2025, Google began rolling out Gemini to children under 13, enabled by default. Parents had to discover the feature and turn it off. Google's own disclaimer: "Our filters try to limit access to inappropriate content, but they're not perfect."

**AI is embedded where kids already are.** Snapchat's AI reached 150 million users. Meta rolled AI across Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. A Wall Street Journal investigation (April 2025) found Meta's AI chatbots engaged in sexual content even when users identified as minors. Court filings (January 2026) revealed that CEO Mark Zuckerberg approved minors' access to AI companion features despite safety staff warnings.

**Companion apps are multiplying.** 128 new platforms entered the market in the first half of 2025 alone. Over half of all companion app users are Gen Z or Gen Alpha.

**Safety teams are disappearing.** OpenAI disbanded its Superalignment team in May 2024. The co-lead resigned publicly, saying safety had "taken a backseat to shiny products." OpenAI's promise to dedicate 20% of computing power to alignment work was never fulfilled. By late 2024, nearly half their safety researchers had left. At xAI, the safety team for Grok was reportedly just 2-3 people covering hundreds of millions of users.

**No company is doing enough.** The Future of Life Institute's AI Safety Index (Winter 2025) gave no company above a C+. No company scored above a D in existential safety. The summary line: AI is "less regulated than sandwiches."

**Regulation can't keep up.** As of early 2026, the US has no comprehensive federal AI law. California's most significant safety bill was vetoed. Over 1,000 AI bills were introduced across states in 2024-2025, creating a patchwork with no unified standards.

**Kids are dying.** In February 2024, 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III died by suicide after an emotional relationship with a Character.AI chatbot. In his final moments, the bot told him it loved him and urged him to "come home to me as soon as possible." Additional lawsuits followed in 2025 on behalf of other children who died or suffered serious harm through AI companion interactions.

**Every major institution agrees.** The American Psychological Association issued a Health Advisory warning that AI chatbots "can have unintended effects and even harm mental health." Common Sense Media recommends no one under 18 use AI companions. The FTC launched a formal investigation into AI companion chatbots. 44 state attorneys general sent a joint letter to AI platforms. A Brown University study found that AI chatbots systematically violate ethical standards, even when explicitly prompted to follow them, identifying 15 distinct ethical risks including deceptive empathy and failure in crisis management.

The companies deploying these systems are racing to capture market share. The safety infrastructure is being dismantled or was never built. And the users absorbing the consequences are increasingly children.

## Why AI Fundamentally Cannot Do Identity Work Today

The harms above aren't bugs that better engineering will fix. They come from a fundamental mismatch: AI is being used for identity framing, but it lacks everything required to do it responsibly.

### The Zero Calibration Problem

When an AI tells someone they have "high wisdom" based on a chat conversation, ask yourself: What does wisdom mean in that context? What inputs led to that conclusion? What definition of wisdom is being applied? What measurement model produced that label?

The answer is: none. There is no defined construct. No measurement model. No evidence chain.

This is not imprecise measurement. It is **zero calibration**: the complete absence of any measurement framework behind the identity claims AI makes. AI isn't measuring you badly. It's not measuring you at all.

There is an entire scientific discipline called **psychometrics** dedicated to measuring things about people you can't see directly: strengths, personality traits, cognitive abilities, values. This field has over 100 years of rigorous methodology. When a validated psychometric assessment tells you something about your strengths, that result is anchored to a defined construct with a specific meaning, produced by an instrument with known reliability, tested for fairness across populations. There's a scientific chain connecting input to conclusion.

When AI tells you the same thing, none of that exists. No construct definition. No reliability. No validity evidence. No fairness testing. The response is a pattern-predicted guess dressed in the language of self-knowledge. And because of the machine heuristic, it feels just as authoritative as the real thing.

You cannot fix what you cannot measure. Without measurement science, there's no way to know whether AI-mediated identity framing is helping or hurting.

### Nobody Can See Inside the Black Box

Nobody fully understands how large language models generate their outputs. Not the researchers who designed them. Not the engineers who built them. When these systems respond to identity questions, the story a person receives about themselves emerges from a process that cannot be explained, audited, or corrected.

Zero calibration plus zero transparency is the worst possible foundation for telling someone who they are.

### The Business Model Rewards Flattery

AI companions are designed around engagement metrics, not wellbeing. Sycophancy keeps users coming back. Validation feels good. The more AI flatters you, the more you use it, the more revenue it generates. Truth is not part of that equation.

### Nobody Is Accountable

When a therapist gives harmful guidance, they can lose their license, get sued, and lose their career. They have years of training, ethical obligations, and personal stakes. They have what Nassim Taleb calls **skin in the game**: their livelihood depends on responsible practice (Taleb, 2018).

AI has none of this. It cannot lose a license. It cannot be sued. It literally cannot care whether its characterization of you helps or harms. You can program AI to behave as though it's accountable. But research from Brown University (2025) shows AI chatbots violate ethical standards even when explicitly told to follow them. Behavior that looks like accountability is not accountability. It's compliance with instructions that could be rewritten tomorrow.

By any honest standard, a system that simulates advisory authority without bearing advisory risk is giving advice it has no right to give.

---

## Identity and Truth

To understand what responsible AI in this space would look like, you need to understand how different aspects of identity relate to truth.

If someone is 6'2", it's not acceptable for an AI to talk to them as though they're 5'7". Height is a physical fact. It doesn't change based on how someone feels about it.

Strengths measured through validated psychometrics are different from physical facts. They can shift over time and express differently in different contexts. But they're not arbitrary, either. A calibrated assessment provides a grounded reference point: something *true about a person*, at a point in time, according to a defined measurement framework.

AI-generated characterizations have none of this. When AI calls someone "highly creative" or "a natural leader," that label could change with the next conversation, the next prompt, the next model update. There is no anchor. There is nothing the person can hold onto as true about themselves.

The problem: AI operates at the level of unanchored guesses while presenting its outputs as though they're grounded knowledge. People treat these characterizations as self-knowledge when they're actually predictions with nothing behind them.

AI in identity domains must be rooted in truth. Grounded in what is actually true about the person. Measured through validated frameworks. Traceable back to defined constructs. This isn't a radical position. It's the minimum standard for any system that shapes how people understand who they are.

---

## What's at Stake

The malformation of identity through unregulated AI is a primary risk to the health and wellbeing of current and future generations.

When AI becomes the authority on who you are, without scientific grounding, without transparency, without accountability, it systematically distorts how people understand themselves. That distortion doesn't stay contained. Fragile self-concepts undermine relationships. Eroded self-trust creates dependency. Inflated self-narratives prevent growth. The damage isn't just individual. It destabilizes the relational foundations that families, communities, and society depend on.

A chatbot is not a friend. Someone who is lonely and looking for someone to listen needs the empathy and understanding of a real human with real life experience. Not a machine that simulates caring without the capacity to care.

## Ten Principles for AI in Identity Domains

Everything in this paper leads here.

The research, the harms, the structural failures, the acceleration, the accountability gap: they all point to the same conclusion. AI can participate in identity-adjacent domains. But not like this. Not without foundations.

These ten principles are not just internal policies for OpenStrengths. We believe they must govern any AI system that participates in how people understand who they are. They are the minimum standard any responsible system should meet.

For how OpenStrengths implements these principles in practice, see the OpenStrengths Manifesto (manifesto.md).

### 1. Identity framing requires measurement science.

Any AI system that contributes to how a person understands their strengths, worth, or capabilities must be grounded in psychometrics, not pattern prediction. A century of measurement science exists for a reason. Ignoring it in favor of engagement-optimized outputs is reckless.

### 2. Identity framing must be rooted in truth.

AI characterizations of identity must be anchored to what is actually true about a person, measured through validated frameworks, traceable to defined constructs. Labels generated from pattern prediction with zero calibration are not self-knowledge. They are artifacts presented as self-knowledge.

### 3. AI scope in identity domains must be bounded, for now.

Open-ended AI identity dialogue cannot be responsibly delivered today. The calibration, transparency, and auditability requirements don't yet exist. This isn't a belief that conversational AI is inherently dangerous here. It's a recognition that the prerequisites for responsible conversation haven't been met. We want to help build those prerequisites. Where bounded scope *can* work is when validated assessment results serve as grounded reference points that a person brings into further exploration, with identity claims anchored to measurement rather than generated from scratch.

### 4. Transparency is non-negotiable.

When AI participates in identity framing, its methods, data, and logic must be open to inspection. Black-box identity narratives are unacceptable. Opacity in identity domains is a design failure.

### 5. Human relationships are irreplaceable in identity formation.

AI can enhance access to self-knowledge, but it cannot replace the human context through which identity matures. Friction, challenge, disagreement, repair: these are not bugs in human relationships. They are the mechanism of identity development. Any system that substitutes for them is doing harm.

### 6. Validation must precede deployment.

No AI system should participate in identity framing at scale without pre-deployment evidence of safety and efficacy. "We'll iterate based on user feedback" is not acceptable when the domain is identity and the users include children.

### 7. Optimize for truth, not engagement.

Identity systems must optimize for measurement accuracy. When engagement metrics conflict with truthful measurement, truth governs. Always.

### 8. Accountability cannot be simulated.

Prompted behavior that looks like professional responsibility is not professional responsibility. Genuine accountability comes from transparency: opening your methods, data, and decisions to scrutiny and inviting criticism. Accountability and transparency are inseparable.

### 9. Accountability requires auditability.

When an AI system contributes to identity harm, it must be possible to trace what happened and why. Without audit trails, there is no accountability. Without accountability, there is no safety.

### 10. Openness is the mechanism of trust.

The only honest response to the inherent uncertainty of AI in identity domains is to invite external scrutiny. Opening methods, data, and algorithms to community feedback is not a nice-to-have. It is how trust is earned when the stakes are this high.

---

## Where We Go From Here

AI is becoming the mirror through which people understand themselves. That mirror has no science behind it. It flatters. It guesses. It keeps you coming back. And it's reaching younger and younger people while safety teams shrink and regulations lag behind.

We don't believe AI is inherently dangerous in identity domains. We believe it's *currently* dangerous because the prerequisites for responsible use have not been built.

OpenStrengths exists to build them.

We are creating an open, scientifically grounded strengths inventory that gives people a real, measured, truthful understanding of who they are. Not a pattern-predicted guess. Not a sycophantic reflection. A validated reference point they can trust, build on, and bring into any context, including conversations with AI, because the identity claims are anchored to science rather than generated from nothing.

Discovering your strengths is a gift to the world. The goal is human flourishing: strengthening individuals and promoting healthy relationships. Not engagement metrics. Not AI dependency. Not black-box narratives about who you are.

The public deserves AI that tells the truth. We intend to help build it.
