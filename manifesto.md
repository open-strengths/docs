# OpenStrengths | Manifesto

## Free. Open. Grounded in Science. Yours.

**February 2026**

Describe yourself, but leave out your age, your gender, your job, and your education. Just who you are underneath.

It's harder than it sounds. The external labels come easy. It's the deeper things that are hard to put into words: how you think, what gives you energy, what you're naturally good at. Most people have never been given language for any of it.

Which is strange, because those are the most durable things about you. Jobs end. Titles change. But the way you're wired stays. It's been with you through every job, every relationship, every big decision you've ever made.

When you finally have the language, when you can actually articulate what's strong in you, it clicks into place. You stop working against your own grain. Decisions get simpler. Relationships make more sense. You understand why some things have always come naturally and others never will.

That clarity doesn't stay inside you. It reaches the people around you. When two people both have language for who they are, the dynamic between them changes. The guessing stops. The performing stops. What's left is real.

Scale that. To a family. A team. A whole generation of people who understand what's strong in them and can see it in each other.

People have always searched for it. It's why personality quizzes go viral. It's why astrology persists. It's why people share their Enneagram type with anyone who'll listen. The desire to understand your own wiring is fundamental. People will reach for whatever's available.

Some of those tools actually deliver. Myers-Briggs gave an entire generation the words "introvert" and "extrovert." Language so common now that most people don't know where it came from. That's what happens when people get real language for how they're wired: it enters the culture and changes how everyone sees themselves. Science-backed assessments like CliftonStrengths go deeper still. People who've experienced them know the difference.

But most people have never had access to anything like that. These assessments cost $30 to $200. Most people only encounter them if an employer provides one. They don't show up where people actually spend their time. Astrology has 83 billion views on TikTok. CliftonStrengths has virtually none. It's not just a cost problem. It's a visibility problem. Behind a paywall, in a corporate context, science-backed tools can't reach the people who need them most.

> **Everyone deserves to know what's strong in them.**

People take the path of least resistance. When the best tools are invisible and the barrier is too high, you work with whatever meets you where you are.

Right now, that's AI.

## The New Normal

AI met people where they already were.

It didn't ask anyone to take a test or pay a fee. It showed up in conversations people were already having and started reflecting things back. You're thinking through a career decision, or processing a relationship, or wondering out loud about who you are, and AI speaks into your identity without anyone naming what's happening.

AI companion apps hit 220 million global downloads in 2025. A third of teens now discuss serious life issues with AI instead of humans.

And AI delivers on the part existing tools never did: it talks with you. It responds to your situation. It's there at 2am. It won't charge you by the hour.

But there's nothing underneath it. No framework. No evidence. Just a prediction of what a helpful answer would sound like, delivered with the confidence of someone who actually measured something. These systems are optimized for engagement, not accuracy. Studies show they validate what you want to hear 50 percent more often than a human would, even when you're wrong.

The consequences go deeper than inaccuracy. Early research suggests that sustained AI identity conversations are reshaping how people trust their own judgment. Young people who rely on AI for self-understanding report lower confidence in their own decision-making. Systems designed for engagement create dependency, not clarity. We've written about these risks in depth in our paper, *[AI Is Telling You Who You Are. Should You Trust It?](ai-safety-for-all.md)*

People aren't foolish for trusting it. The desire to understand yourself is real, and AI is the first thing that's tried to serve all of it: not just a score, but understanding, application, someone to think it through with.

It just does it with nothing real underneath.

## What We Believe

**Telling someone who they are requires truth, and truth requires measurement science.** If something is real about a person, it can be defined and measured. Any system that shapes how people understand themselves must be anchored to what's actually true about them, not to what sounds plausible. When accuracy and engagement metrics conflict, truth wins. Always.

**Built for humans, not to replace them.** Identity matures through human relationships, through friction, challenge, disagreement, and repair. Technology in this space should make it easier for people to understand themselves and each other. The goal is human-to-human clarity, not human-to-AI dependency.

**Self-knowledge is a right, not a product.** Understanding what's strong in you shouldn't require a paywall. The most important tools for self-understanding should be accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford them.

**Your identity data belongs to you.** When you learn something true about yourself, that insight is yours. Not a platform's. Not a vendor's. You should control where it goes and who sees it.

**Measurement should fit the person, not the other way around.** When an assessment is a barrier, you're measuring the barrier, not the person. Language, context, and reading level matter. Rigor and accessibility are not in conflict.

**AI should not characterize who you are.** AI can support the process of self-understanding. It should not be the one making identity claims. Telling someone who they are requires calibrated measurement, not pattern prediction dressed as insight.

**If it's true, show your work.** Anyone claiming to measure who people are owes the world the ability to check their work. Open methods. Open data. Open to scrutiny. That's how trust is earned when the stakes are this high.

## Who We Are

We met in Kansas City through family years ago. Over time we discovered we shared something: a belief that people with less economic mobility deserve better tools for understanding themselves, and a frustration that those tools didn't exist.

We spent years working on projects together in communities where economic opportunity was hardest to reach. The common thread kept surfacing: it mattered to know what people were strong in. Both of us had seen what happens when someone finally gets real language for how they're wired.

Robert started using StrengthsFinder close to fifteen years ago. He already knew what produced results in his life. He just didn't have language for it. StrengthsFinder gave him that, and it reinforced something else: he wasn't built to be everything. He took the same lens into his family, doing StrengthsFinder with all his kids. He started seeing patterns: similarities across different children, differences that explained how they related to each other, where friction came from and where connection ran deepest. It gave him language as a father, not just as a leader.

Then the picture got bigger. He analyzed over 200 workforce development programs while working with HUD in D.C. What hit him hardest: people on means-tested services are almost never given strengths inventories. They're given deficit inventories. The system assesses what's lacking to categorize needs and justify services. It bypasses the person's strengths entirely. It meets needs but doesn't build capacity. People are known by their deficits. They have to prove what's wrong to qualify. They rarely get language for what's strong. He couldn't stop asking what would change if they did.

Zach took every assessment he could find early in his career: DISC, Myers-Briggs, StrengthsFinder, the Enneagram. StrengthsFinder was the one that stuck. His top strength was Futuristic, and it named something he'd never had language for. He'd always seen where things were heading before the people around him. He'd act on it, and the gap between what he could see and what he could get others to see had defined most of his career. Once he had the word for it, he stopped trying to convince people and started learning to paint the picture for them.

At the bottom of his list was Discipline. That was harder to sit with. And it connected to the top in a way he didn't expect: seeing the future is only valuable if you can act on what you see. He'd spent years caught between vision and execution, able to see where things were going but paralyzed by which action now would bring him closer or push him further away. The assessment helped him understand why. He learned to tell the difference between his gut offering signal and his gut creating noise. When he was confident in what he saw, he stopped over-calculating and started moving.

He brought strength assessments into every team he led. The teams were more effective, but that wasn't what stayed with him. It was that people felt seen. A company caring enough to learn what was strong in them changed the dynamic before any work got done. People understood why they worked the way they did and why the person next to them worked differently. That was when it stopped being about his own clarity and became about what this could do for anyone.

We kept trying to bring strength assessments into the work we were doing together. Every time, we hit the same walls: cost, locked data, no API, no way to integrate strengths into the tools we actually used. The tools worked, but they weren't built to go anywhere. So in 2025, we decided to build our own.

## What We're Building

OpenStrengths is a free, open, scientifically grounded strengths assessment. It measures 36 facets of human strength across six domains:

- **Insight** — how you process, analyze, and understand
- **Creativity** — how you imagine, invent, and adapt
- **Drive** — how you pursue, persist, and achieve
- **Stability** — how you regulate, endure, and stay grounded
- **Connection** — how you relate, empathize, and bond
- **Influence** — how you lead, persuade, and mobilize

We started by defining what we're measuring: 36 facets, each with a precise description of what it means. AI then generated thousands of questions across every variant of person and context the assessment might encounter. Every item was tested before it entered the library. Does it measure what it claims to? Does it hold up across groups? Does it maintain calibration? If not, it doesn't get in.

When you take the assessment, you start with a brief questionnaire about your context and reading level. From there, you receive questions from this pre-verified library, matched to you.

Consider how "Curiosity" might be measured. A standard item reads: *"I enjoy exploring new ideas and concepts."* For a high school student: *"I like learning about new things."* For a professional: *"I actively seek out emerging trends and insights in my field."* All three measure the same quality. All three have been verified to do so. Each one meets the person where they are.

AI's role is bounded. It generates questions. It verifies them. It can explain your results and ask you questions to deepen understanding. It cannot make inferences about who you are. It cannot characterize you. Your results come from calibrated measurement, not from a conversation where AI decides what's true about you.

Your results come in reports designed to be understood by humans, built to make it easy to share what you've learned and invite the people around you into the process. If you want to use your results with AI tools, we provide files designed to ground AI in what's actually been measured: prompt-level instructions paired with your strength data, so any AI you work with starts from something true about you instead of generating from scratch.

Your results belong to you. Take them to a therapist, a manager, a learning app. Share them with anyone. Revoke access whenever you choose.

We're building it in the open. For anyone who wants to track our progress, follow our research, question our methodology, or see what's ahead, it's all in the [OpenStrengths Technical White Paper](whitepaper.md).

## What We Need

If anything you've read resonates with you, join us with focus.

OpenStrengths is a nonprofit, open-source project. To date, the work has been self-funded. Our remaining budget to complete validation and launch the public assessment is $2.2 million.

The most direct way to help is to underwrite validation: participant recruitment, research infrastructure, expert review, and the work required to publish an assessment the public can actually trust.

We are also seeking a limited number of partners aligned to specific needs:

**Psychometric partners** to review methodology, pressure-test the gates, and co-design validation protocols. We're seeking collaboration, not rubber stamps.

**Academic organizations** to participate in validation studies, provide diverse participant populations, and contribute to peer-reviewed publications.

**Applied experts** in trauma-informed communication, youth development, assessment item writing, plain-language measurement, and Industrial-Organizational psychology, so the instrument and its language remain both rigorous and human-honoring.

**Technical builders** who can strengthen evaluation harnesses and quality gates, ensuring adaptivity stays anchored to defined constructs.

If that's you, reach out with a clear subject line indicating your lane.

The question isn't whether AI will shape how people understand themselves. It already does.

The question is whether there will be anything real underneath when it does.

> **OpenStrengths is building that foundation.**
