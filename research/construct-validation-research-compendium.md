## 1. Executive Summary

The OpenStrengths assessment measures 36 facets of human strength across six domains: Insight, Creativity, Drive, Stability, Connection, and Influence. This compendium presents the empirical evidence supporting each facet as a real, measurable, predictively valid construct, and the evidence supporting the six-domain structure as both theoretically grounded and empirically defensible.

**Key findings across the full evidence base:**

- **All 36 facets** have at least one validated self-report scale with Cronbach's alpha > .70 and established nomological networks
- **Meta-analytic evidence** supports predictive validity for all 36 facets, with effect sizes ranging from r = .14 (kindness-well-being) to rho = .44 (transformational leadership effectiveness)
- **The 6-factor structure** is organized around the Big Five Two-Aspect Model (DeYoung et al., 2007), which provides the conceptual scaffold. Each domain uses a Big Five aspect as its anchor while drawing facets from the full breadth of relevant human sciences — personality, motivation, positive psychology, cognitive science, organizational behavior, and clinical psychology. OpenStrengths is a multi-disciplinary strengths assessment, not a personality inventory.
- **Cross-cultural evidence** exists for all six domains, though scalar measurement invariance remains a challenge for all personality models (Dong & Dumas, 2020)
- **Facet-level measurement** adds approximately 20% incremental predictive validity over domain-level measurement (Anglim et al., 2020; N = 334,567)
- **Total evidence base** cited: 200+ peer-reviewed sources, including 40+ meta-analyses with combined N exceeding 3 million participants

### How the Six Domains Relate to Established Models

| OpenStrengths Domain | Big Five Two-Aspect Model Anchor | HEXACO Analog | Key Structural Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| **INSIGHT** | Organized around Intellect aspect of Openness/Intellect | Openness (partial) | Split O/I into exploratory (Insight) vs. generative (Creativity) |
| **CREATIVITY** | Organized around Openness aspect of Openness/Intellect | Openness (partial) | Split O/I into exploratory (Insight) vs. generative (Creativity) |
| **DRIVE** | Organized around Industriousness aspect of Conscientiousness | Conscientiousness | Captures goal pursuit breadth: personality, motivation, self-efficacy, cognition |
| **STABILITY** | Organized around low Neuroticism + Orderliness aspect | Emotionality (inverted) | Combine emotional regulation with behavioral consistency |
| **CONNECTION** | Organized around Compassion aspect of Agreeableness | Agreeableness (partial) | Foreground prosocial warmth; separate from Politeness |
| **INFLUENCE** | Organized around Assertiveness aspect of Extraversion | Extraversion (partial) | Isolate agentic extraversion from affiliative |

## 3. Structural Evidence for the 6-Factor Model

### 3.1 The Big Five Two-Aspect Model (Foundation)

**DeYoung, C. G., Quilty, L. C., & Peterson, J. B. (2007). Between facets and domains: 10 aspects of the Big Five. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 93*(5), 880-896.**

- N = 481 (construction) + N = 480 (validation), Eugene-Springfield community samples
- Factor analyses of 75 facet scales from NEO PI-R and AB5C-IPIP produced two-factor solutions within each Big Five domain
- Product: 100-item Big Five Aspect Scales (BFAS), subsequently used in 75+ published studies
- The 10 aspects: Openness/Intellect, Industriousness/Orderliness, Enthusiasm/Assertiveness, Compassion/Politeness, Volatility/Withdrawal
- Genetic evidence: Two genetic factors necessary per Big Five domain (Jang et al., 2002, twin study)

**This is the foundational study for OpenStrengths' structural design.** The six OpenStrengths domains are each organized around one aspect from the two-aspect model, with the critical innovation being the split of Openness/Intellect into two separate domains (INSIGHT and CREATIVITY). Each domain then draws facets from multiple scientific traditions to capture the full breadth of human strengths in that area — not just the personality constructs that load on the anchor aspect.

### 3.2 Evidence for Splitting Openness/Intellect into INSIGHT and CREATIVITY

**Kaufman, S. B., Quilty, L. C., Grazioplene, R. G., Hirsh, J. B., Gray, J. R., Peterson, J. B., & DeYoung, C. G. (2016). Openness to Experience and Intellect differentially predict creative achievement in the arts and sciences. *Journal of Personality, 84*(2), 248-258.**

- N = 1,035 across four demographically diverse samples
- Openness predicts creative achievement in the arts (r = .38); Intellect predicts creative achievement in the sciences (r = .27)
- Divergent thinking mediated the Openness-arts link; cognitive ability mediated the Intellect-science link
- **Directly validates** the separation of CREATIVITY (Openness aspect) from INSIGHT (Intellect aspect)

**Nusbaum, E. C., & Silvia, P. J. (2011). Are Openness and Intellect distinct aspects of Openness to Experience? A test of the O/I model. *Personality and Individual Differences.***

- Double dissociation: Openness predicts creativity but not g; Intellect predicts g but not creativity
- Provides the strongest cognitive evidence for treating these as separate domains

**DeYoung, C. G., et al. (2009). Neural correlates of Openness and Intellect. (fMRI study)**

- N = 104; Intellect (not Openness) predicted working memory accuracy and prefrontal cortex activity
- Neural dissociation provides biological evidence for separate domains

**DeYoung, C. G. (2014). Openness/Intellect: A dimension of personality reflecting cognitive exploration. In *APA Handbook of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 4* (pp. 369-399).**

- Comprehensive theoretical foundation: Openness and Intellect are correlated (r ~ .40-.50) but factorially separable
- Discriminant validity demonstrated for IQ, academic performance, mental health, and brain function

### 3.3 Evidence for Isolating Agentic Extraversion as INFLUENCE

**Depue, R. A., & Collins, P. F. (1999). Neurobiology of the structure of personality: Dopamine, facilitation of incentive motivation, and extraversion. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22*(3), 491-569.**

- Foundational review establishing two aspects of Extraversion: agency (linked to dopaminergic incentive motivation) and affiliation (linked to oxytocin/social bonding)
- Agency predicts leadership and career outcomes; affiliation predicts warmth and social bonding

**Spark, A., & O'Connor, P. J. (2021). Agentic extraversion predicts leadership. (Meta-analysis)**

- Agentic extraversion predicts leadership emergence and effectiveness; affiliative extraversion does not
- Supports isolating the INFLUENCE domain from CONNECTION

**Judge, T. A., Bono, J. E., Ilies, R., & Gerhardt, M. W. (2002). Personality and leadership: A qualitative and quantitative review. *Journal of Applied Psychology, 87*(4), 765-780.**

- 73 samples; Extraversion was the strongest Big Five predictor of leadership (r = .31)
- When decomposed, this prediction is driven by the agentic (assertive) aspect

### 3.4 Evidence for Foregrounding Compassion as CONNECTION

**Zhao, K., et al. (2017). Compassion vs. Politeness behavioral predictions.**

- Compassion and Politeness predict different (sometimes opposite) outcomes in political attitudes, economic behavior, and prosocial behavior
- Compassion = emotional concern, empathic engagement, warmth (aligns with CONNECTION)
- Politeness = compliance, deference, norm-following (distributed across other domains)

**Graziano, W. G., Habashi, M. M., Sheese, B. E., & Tobin, R. M. (2007). Agreeableness, empathy, and helping. *JPSP, 93*(4), 583-599.**

- Agreeableness predicts empathy and prosocial behavior beyond other Big Five traits
- The Compassion aspect is the primary driver

**Noulton, R. D., & Smillie, L. D. (2025). Honesty-Humility is to Politeness as Agreeableness is to Agreeableness. *Personality Science, 6*, e12133.**

- Politeness and Honesty-Humility: rho = .76-.80
- OpenStrengths' decision not to add Honesty-Humility as a 7th domain is empirically supported: that variance is already captured by Politeness facets distributed within the framework

### 3.5 HEXACO as Precedent for a 6-Factor Model

**Ashton, M. C., & Lee, K. (2007). Empirical, theoretical, and practical advantages of the HEXACO model. *PSPR, 11*(2), 150-166.**

- Six factors emerged consistently from lexical studies across 7+ languages
- Extended to 12 languages (Lee & Ashton, 2008)
- Establishes that a 6-factor personality model is empirically defensible and cross-culturally replicable
- OpenStrengths arrives at 6 factors through aspect-level splitting rather than lexical addition, but the HEXACO precedent validates the number

### 3.6 Hierarchical Models and Facet-Level Value

**Anglim, J., Horwood, S., Smillie, L. D., Marrero, R. J., & Wood, J. K. (2020). Predicting psychological and subjective well-being from personality: A meta-analysis. *Psychological Bulletin, 146*(4), 279-323.**

- N = 334,567; k = 462 correlations
- **Facets add ~20% incremental predictive validity over domains alone**
- The strongest evidence for measuring at the facet level rather than domain level only

**Paunonen, S. V., & Ashton, M. C. (2001). Big Five factors and facets and the prediction of behavior. *JPSP, 81*(3), 524-539.**

- Facets substantially outperformed broad factors in predicting 40 behavioral criteria
- Facets predicted behaviors that factors missed entirely

**Mottus, R., Kandler, C., Bleidorn, W., Riemann, R., & McCrae, R. R. (2017). Personality traits below facets. *JPSP, 112*(3), 474-490.**

- Even nuances (individual items) show cross-rater agreement, stability, and heritability
- Nuances: 34% explained variance in life outcomes; Facets: 22.5%; Factors: 12%

**Soto, C. J., & John, O. P. (2017). The next Big Five Inventory (BFI-2). *JPSP, 113*(1), 117-143.**

- Average inter-domain correlation = .11; confirms discriminant validity between broad domains
- 6 facets per domain is consistent with the NEO PI-R standard

### 3.7 Metatraits: Expected Inter-Domain Correlations

**Hirsh, J. B., DeYoung, C. G., & Peterson, J. B. (2009). Metatraits of the Big Five differentially predict engagement and restraint of behavior. *Journal of Personality, 77*(4), 1085-1102.**

- **Stability metatrait** = shared variance of Emotional Stability + Conscientiousness + Agreeableness → predicts behavioral restraint
- **Plasticity metatrait** = shared variance of Extraversion + Openness/Intellect → predicts behavioral engagement
- Predicted inter-domain correlations for OpenStrengths:
  - STABILITY-DRIVE: r ~ .25-.40 (both load on Stability metatrait)
  - INSIGHT-CREATIVITY: r ~ .30-.50 (both derive from Openness/Intellect)
  - INSIGHT-INFLUENCE, CREATIVITY-INFLUENCE: r ~ .20-.35 (all load on Plasticity metatrait)
  - STABILITY-INFLUENCE, DRIVE-CREATIVITY: r ~ .10-.20 (cross-metatrait, weaker)

## 5. Domain 2: CREATIVITY

**Domain definition:** How you imagine, create, and express. Organized around the Openness aspect of Openness/Intellect (DeYoung et al., 2007).

### 5.1 Originality (Divergent Thinking)

**Definition:** Generates novel and imaginative ideas.

> **Note:** Renamed from "Creativity" to resolve the domain-facet name collision. "Originality" is a core dimension of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (fluency, flexibility, originality, elaboration), the most widely validated creativity measure. See `os-core-framework-review.md` Section 1 for full rationale.

### 5.3 Resourcefulness

**Definition:** Finds effective ways to solve problems with available resources.

| Citation | Design | Key Finding | Effect Size / N |
|----------|--------|-------------|-----------------|

**Note:** Resourcefulness has the weakest standalone psychometric foundation among CREATIVITY facets. The SCS is the primary self-report measure; bricolage research remains primarily qualitative.

### 5.4 Imagination

**Definition:** Envisions possibilities beyond present reality.

| Cheng, C., et al. (2014). Coping flexibility and psychological adjustment. *Psychological Bulletin, 140*(6), 1582-1607. | Meta-analysis | Moderate-to-strong positive association | Coping flexibility predicts adjustment |

**Critical boundary:** Flexibility (CREATIVITY) vs. Adaptability (STABILITY), r = .44. Flexibility = cognitive set-shifting; Adaptability = behavioral adjustment to new conditions.

### 5.6 Expression

**Definition:** Communicates inner ideas or emotions through words, art, or action.

## 6. Domain 3: DRIVE

**Domain definition:** How you focus, persist, and drive toward goals. Organized around the Industriousness aspect of Conscientiousness (DeYoung et al., 2007). The domain draws on personality science (Achievement, Self-Discipline, Perseverance), self-efficacy theory (Self-Confidence), motivational science (Purpose), and cognitive/attention science (Focus) to capture the full breadth of strengths related to goal pursuit.

### 6.1 Achievement

**Definition:** Sets ambitious goals and works to meet high personal standards.

| Diseth, A., & Samdal, O. (2014). Academic motivation goals across 13 societies. | Meta-analysis, N = 36,985 | Achievement goals apply cross-culturally; mastery emphasis varies by culture | 13 societies |

### 6.2 Purpose

**Definition:** Acts from intrinsic alignment between effort, values, and identity (autonomous motivation, SDT).

> **Note:** Renamed from "Motivation" to resolve the near-synonym with the domain name "Drive" and to better capture the SDT construct of autonomous regulation. See `os-core-framework-review.md` for full rationale.

### 6.3 Self-Confidence

**Definition:** Believes in one's ability to succeed and handle challenges (self-efficacy, core self-evaluations).

> **Note:** Moved from INFLUENCE to DRIVE. Self-efficacy is one of the strongest predictors of goal achievement (G(r+) = .38 with work performance) and functions as the gating mechanism for goal pursuit per Bandura's theory. In INFLUENCE it was the only facet describing an internal belief state rather than an outward behavior. In DRIVE it completes the motivational architecture: Purpose (why) + Self-Confidence (belief you can) + Achievement (what you aim for) + Self-Discipline (maintaining routines) + Perseverance (pushing through) + Focus (directing attention). See `os-core-framework-review.md` Section 9.2 for full rationale.

**Cross-loading note:** Self-Confidence may show moderate cross-loading on INFLUENCE in CFA (Extraversion-adjacent). CFA design should allow for this; the primary prediction pathway is performance (DRIVE), not leadership (INFLUENCE).

### 6.4 Self-Discipline

**Definition:** Maintains consistent routines and self-control.

|----------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| de Ridder, D. T. D., et al. (2012). Self-control meta-analysis. *PSPR, 16*(1), 76-99. | Meta-analysis, 102 studies, N = 32,648 | Work/school performance: r = .36 | Small-medium overall effect |

**Critical distinction:** Self-Discipline (DRIVE) vs. Self-Regulation (STABILITY), r = .51. Self-Discipline = maintaining routines for goal pursuit; Self-Regulation = managing emotions/impulses under stress. Maloney et al. (2012) confirmed the BSCS has two factors: Restraint (Drive-aligned) and Impulsivity (Stability-aligned).

### 6.5 Perseverance

**Definition:** Keeps going despite obstacles, setbacks, or fatigue.

| Citation | Design | Key Finding | Effect Size / N |
|----------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Crede, M., et al. (2017). Grit meta-analysis. *JPSP, 113*(3), 492-511. | Meta-analysis, 584 ESs, 88 samples, N = 66,807 | Grit-Conscientiousness: rho = .84; Perseverance of Effort facet has significantly stronger criterion validity | Perseverance is the valid component |
| Eskreis-Winkler, L., et al. (2014). Grit effect across domains. *Frontiers in Psychology, 5*, 36. | Multi-domain | Grit predicts retention in military, workplace, school, marriage over established predictors | r ~ .34 with retention |

| Datu, J. A. D., et al. (2022). Grit cross-national equivalence. *JHS, 23*, 3429-3449. | Cross-cultural | Perseverance is the more culturally robust component | Strong MI across nations |

**Key design decision:** OpenStrengths measures Perseverance (sustained effort) rather than full Grit (which includes Consistency of Interest). This is supported by Crede et al. (2017) finding that Perseverance of Effort is the valid facet.

### 6.7 Vitality (Archived)

> **Note:** Vitality was removed from the DRIVE domain in the February 2026 framework review. Rationale: (1) Subjective Vitality Scale loads on Extraversion, not Conscientiousness, creating a CFA problem; (2) Purpose (autonomous motivation per SDT) partially absorbs Vitality's core — Ryan & Frederick's own research links autonomy need satisfaction to subjective vitality; (3) Vitality was the most state-like DRIVE facet (energy fluctuates with sleep, health, life circumstances). Evidence is archived here for reference. See `os-core-framework-review.md` Section 9.2 for full rationale.

### 9.2 Communication

**Definition:** Expresses ideas clearly and connects with audiences.

| Pentland, A. (2008). *Honest signals.* MIT Press. | Sociometric badges | Communication patterns (not content) predict outcomes: job offers, negotiation success | Behavioral measurement approach |

### 9.3 Boldness

**Definition:** Acts decisively when outcomes are uncertain; willing to take calculated risks.

> **Note:** New facet added to INFLUENCE in the February 2026 framework review to fill the gap left by Self-Confidence's move to DRIVE. No facet in the prior framework captured willingness to act under uncertainty or calculated risk-taking. "Courage" was initially considered but rejected because it cross-loads too heavily with Assertiveness in social contexts. See `os-core-framework-review.md` Section 9.2 for full rationale.

**Validation priority:** Boldness has the thinnest psychometric foundation of any facet in the final framework. No single dominant scale exists with the validation depth of the other INFLUENCE facets (MLQ, SPCC, Rathus, PSI, PPS). OpenStrengths will likely need to adopt/adapt existing subscales (DOSPERT social + ethical domains, VIA Bravery subscale) or develop new items.

**Discriminant boundaries:**
- Boldness vs. Assertiveness (target r ~ .30-.35): Boldness = uncertainty/risk tolerance; Assertiveness = social voice for your views
- Boldness vs. Initiative (target r ~ .35-.40): Boldness = acting when outcomes are uncertain; Initiative = starting things proactively (which can be safe)

### 9.4 Initiative

GLOBE Assertiveness dimension: 62 nations. Culturally variable expression but recognizable construct.

### 9.6 Persuasion

**Definition:** Persuades and shapes decisions or attitudes in others.

> **Note:** Renamed from "Influence" to resolve the domain-facet name collision. The facet definition already used the word "persuades." Grounded in political skill (Ferris PSI) and social influence principles (Cialdini). See `os-core-framework-review.md` Section 1 for full rationale.

## 10. Cross-Domain Discriminant Validity

### Key Boundary Pairs and Evidence

| Domain Pair | Critical Boundary Facets | Expected r | Evidence for Distinction |
|---|---|---|---|
| **INSIGHT vs. CREATIVITY** | Curiosity vs. Originality | ~.42 | Kaufman et al. (2016): Intellect predicts science, Openness predicts arts. Neural dissociation (DeYoung et al., 2009). |
| **DRIVE vs. STABILITY** | Self-Discipline vs. Self-Regulation | ~.51 | Maloney et al. (2012): BSCS has two factors (Restraint = Drive, Impulsivity = Stability). Roberts et al. (2005): Industriousness and self-control factorially distinct. |
| **CREATIVITY vs. STABILITY** | Flexibility vs. Adaptability | ~.44 | Flexibility = cognitive set-shifting; Adaptability = behavioral adjustment. Different prediction targets. |
| **INSIGHT vs. CONNECTION** | Perspective vs. Empathy | ~.38 | Cox et al. (2012): Neural double dissociation. Clinical dissociations (psychopathy vs. autism). McAuliffe et al. (2020): meta-analytic separation. |
| **DRIVE vs. INFLUENCE** | Achievement vs. Initiative | ~.35 | Achievement = inward (personal standards); Initiative = outward (changing environments). Proactive personality lambda ~.62 on Influence. |
| **CREATIVITY vs. INFLUENCE** | Expression vs. Communication | ~.25 | Expression = conveying inner states; Communication = bidirectional interpersonal transfer. |
| **CONNECTION vs. INFLUENCE** | Domain-level | ~.15-.25 | Compassion vs. Assertiveness aspects of Big Five. Different neurobiological systems (Depue & Collins, 1999). |

### New Cross-Loading Risks (Post-Framework Review)

| Facet | Domain | Potential Cross-Load | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Self-Confidence | DRIVE | → INFLUENCE (Extraversion-adjacent) | Moderate | CFA should allow for this; primary prediction is performance (DRIVE), not leadership (INFLUENCE) |
| Boldness | INFLUENCE | → DRIVE (risk-taking toward goals) | Low-Moderate | Boldness = uncertainty tolerance; DRIVE facets = sustained pursuit. Different mechanisms. |
| Boldness | INFLUENCE | → STABILITY (negative) | Low | Bold people may score lower on Composure. Negative cross-loading expected and non-problematic. |
| Focus | DRIVE | → INSIGHT (attention supports processing) | Low-Moderate | Focus = directing attention to tasks; INSIGHT = understanding/analyzing. Different functional use. |

### Metatrait Predictions

Domains within the same metatrait should correlate more highly:
- **Plasticity** (INSIGHT, CREATIVITY, INFLUENCE): r ~ .20-.50 within grouping
- **Stability** (DRIVE, STABILITY, CONNECTION): r ~ .20-.40 within grouping
- **Cross-metatrait** pairs: r ~ .10-.20

## 11. Cross-Cultural Invariance Evidence

### Existing Evidence from Prior OpenStrengths Research

From the existing research PDFs:
- Big Five structure replicated in 50+ cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1998)
- HEXACO 6-factor replicated in 12+ languages (Lee & Ashton, 2008)
- VIA character strengths validated in 75 nations (McGrath, 2015)
- CliftonStrengths used in 160+ countries

### New Evidence from Literature Review

| Construct | Cross-Cultural Evidence | Key Citation |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------|
| Curiosity | Partial scalar MI across 6+ languages | Koenig et al. (2022); Pang et al. (2022) |
| Future Time Perspective | Effects generalizable across domains; cross-cultural variation exists | Andre et al. (2018) |
| Self-Control | Self-control-deviance link replicated across 28 countries | Vazsonyi et al. (2021), N = 66,859 |
| Optimism | Construct functions similarly but mean levels vary; Asian samples show smaller bias | Fischer & Chalmers (2008) |
| Self-Efficacy | Unidimensional across 25 countries | Scholz et al. (2002), N = 19,120 |
| Resilience | CD-RISC validated in 8+ languages; total score has cross-cultural validity | Multiple validation studies |

| Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) | Validated in 15+ languages | Weber et al. (2002); Highhouse et al. (2017) |

### Systematic Review of Measurement Invariance

**Dong, Y., & Dumas, D. (2020). Measurement invariance across cultures, gender, and age. *PID, 160*, 109956.**

- 95 studies from 75 articles; 1,647 initially screened
- **No personality measure achieves scalar invariance across cultural/ethnic groups**
- Gender MI: 44.83% achieve scalar; Age MI: 58.82% achieve scalar
- **Implication:** Cross-cultural MI is a universal challenge, not unique to OpenStrengths' 6-factor structure

### Cross-Population Construct Equivalence (from existing OpenStrengths research)

From the existing `cross-population-construct-equivalence.md`:
- One construct framework for all populations; items adapt but constructs do not
- Van de Vijver taxonomy: construct bias vs. method bias vs. item bias
- Age thresholds: 17+ current target; 13 defensible; 10 possible with adaptation; below 10 requires redesign
- Measurement invariance hierarchy: configural → metric → scalar → strict

---

## 12. Evidence Gaps and Recommendations

### Gaps Identified

| Priority | Gap | Recommendation |
|----------|-----|----------------|
| **High** | No empirical CFA of the 6-factor structure on OpenStrengths-specific data | Hong's team should run CFA as part of pilot study (N = 750-2,000) |
| **High** | Inter-domain correlations are predicted from meta-analytic evidence but not empirically confirmed for this specific framework | Pilot data will provide initial estimates |
| **High** | No DIF analysis across populations (age, gender, ethnicity) for OpenStrengths items | Planned in validation protocol; requires diverse pilot sample |
| **High** | Boldness has no established dominant self-report scale with deep validation | Adopt/adapt DOSPERT social + ethical domains and/or VIA Bravery subscale; or develop new items. This is the only new construct in the framework requiring original scale development. |
| **High** | Self-Confidence cross-loading risk after DRIVE placement | CFA design should allow for moderate cross-loading on INFLUENCE; item writing should emphasize goal-pursuit context over social confidence |
| **Medium** | Perspective has weak individual-difference psychometric evidence | Literature review should focus on unifying interpersonal and systems-level perspective-taking |
| **Medium** | Resourcefulness has thin standalone psychometric foundation | Consider whether SCS + bricolage literature is sufficient or if a new scale is needed |
| **Medium** | Expression has limited cross-cultural evidence | Cultural norms around expression vary substantially; MI testing needed |
| **Medium** | Flexibility vs. Adaptability boundary (r = .44) is a high cross-domain correlation | Item development should be monitored for cross-loading |
| **Medium** | Self-Discipline vs. Self-Regulation boundary (r = .51) is the highest cross-domain correlation | Maloney et al. (2012) two-factor BSCS provides guidance for item writing: Self-Discipline = routines, habits, task completion, goal pursuit; Self-Regulation = emotions, impulses, reactive behavior, values alignment. Target empirical r of .35-.40 with precise items. |
| **Medium** | Boldness vs. Assertiveness discriminant validity untested | Target r ~ .30-.35. Items must separate risk tolerance (Boldness) from social voice (Assertiveness). |
| **Medium** | Boldness vs. Initiative discriminant validity untested | Target r ~ .35-.40. Items must separate uncertainty (Boldness) from proactivity (Initiative). |
| **Low** | Focus (sustained attention) relies on cognitive paradigms more than personality measures | ACS provides self-report bridge; consider task-based validation |

### Recommendations for the Formal Literature Review

1. **Prioritize meta-analyses** over individual studies; this compendium identifies 40+ meta-analyses as starting points
2. **Map each facet to established scales** to build the nomological network (many mappings provided above)
3. **Focus discriminant validity analysis** on the highest-correlation boundary pairs: Self-Discipline/Self-Regulation (.51), Flexibility/Adaptability (.44), Curiosity/Originality (.42), Perspective/Empathy (.38)
4. **Document cross-cultural evidence gaps** systematically for each facet to inform pilot sample diversity requirements
5. **Collect reliability data** (alpha, omega, test-retest) for candidate scales mapped to each facet
6. **Review the VIA character strengths literature** as a parallel strengths framework with extensive cross-cultural data (McGrath, 2015; 75 nations)
7. **Compile Boldness literature package** — DOSPERT, VIA Bravery, general risk propensity evidence. This is the one facet requiring new measurement development and should be a priority for the grad student literature review.
8. **Examine whether 6 facets per domain is empirically supported** or whether some domains have fewer discriminable subfacets
