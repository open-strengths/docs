# OpenStrengths Construct Validation Plan v1.0

## 1. Purpose and outcomes

This plan defines the exact procedure OpenStrengths will use to validate the conceptual model for the strengths assessment before any item pilots, calibration, or adaptive testing. The outcomes of this plan are:

1. A validated construct model for six domains and thirty-six facets with clear, non-overlapping, behaviorally anchored definitions.
2. A documented content validity study with expert judgments, agreement statistics, and a revision log.
3. A decision record that authorizes the project to proceed into item modeling and first computer-based pilots.

## 2. Scope

This plan covers the following work only:

1. Expert validation of domain and facet definitions.
2. Analysis of expert agreement and qualitative feedback.
3. One or more revision cycles to reach expert consensus.

This plan explicitly does not cover item pilots, calibration, or adaptive testing. Those come after this validation is complete.

## 3. Model summary to be validated

### 3.1 Domains

OpenStrengths organizes strengths into six domains. Current working domain labels are:

1. Insight
2. Creativity
3. Drive
4. Stability
5. Connection
6. Influence

### 3.2 Facets

Each domain contains multiple facets. The target total across all domains is thirty-six facets. Insert the current canonical list into the table below before circulating to experts.

| Domain | Facet name | Draft facet definition (1-2 sentences) | Rationale for inclusion (1-2 sentences) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Insight | Curiosity | Actively seeks out new knowledge and experiences. | Represents a distinct motivational state (the "want to know") that predicts information-seeking behavior independent of openness to experience or learning ability. |
| Insight | Perspective | Understands situations from a broad or different point of view. | Rooted in Theory of Mind research as the differentiated cognitive ability to shift viewpoints, serving as one component of wisdom rather than wisdom itself. |
| Insight | Learning | Quickly acquires and applies new skills or knowledge. | Conceptualized as learning agility that predicts leadership performance beyond IQ or experience through ability to learn from experience and apply it under new conditions. |
| Insight | Foresight | Anticipates future needs and likely outcomes. | Represents future time perspective involving distinct neurocognitive mechanisms for simulating and predicting future events through prospection, separate from wisdom's value-laden judgment. |
| Insight | Wisdom | Balances knowledge, judgment, and values in decisions. | Integrates cognitive, reflective, and affective components into coherent approach to complex problems, distinguished from intelligence by emphasis on balancing uncertainty and common good. |
| Insight | Self-Reflection | Examines one's own thoughts, feelings, and behavior. | Represents intrapersonal intelligence characterized by affective awareness and metacognition—understanding one's own mental processes distinct from understanding how one differs from others. |
| Creativity | Creativity | Generates novel and imaginative ideas. | Defined as generating ideas that are both original and valuable within real-world constraints, representing applied imagination rather than unreal thoughts free from reality. |
| Creativity | Innovation | Transforms ideas into practical, adopted solutions. | Distinguishes itself from creativity by focusing on practical implementation and adoption into real-world impact rather than merely novel ideation. |
| Creativity | Resourcefulness | Finding effective ways to solve problems with what is available. | Learned resourcefulness involving self-control, problem-solving, and self-efficacy applied to work creatively within constraints rather than generate novelty unconstrained. |
| Creativity | Imagination | Envisions possibilities beyond present reality. | Operates at level of phenomenology and possibility free from the conventions or constraints that define creativity, triggering creativity and innovation. |
| Creativity | Flexibility | Adjusts thinking or approach when circumstances change. | Involves five distinct cognitive processes (elaborating, dimensionalizing, integrating, juxtaposing, matching) enabling adaptation of thinking, supported by unique neural mechanisms. |
| Creativity | Expression | Communicates inner ideas or emotions through words, art, or action. | The tendency to outwardly display emotions and inner states serving communicative and intraindividual regulatory functions, distinct from bidirectional communication. |
| Drive | Achievement | Strives toward high standards and significant results. | Grounded in Achievement Goal Theory's multifaceted framework distinguishing mastery/performance orientations that predict outcomes through self-efficacy, separate from persistence. |
| Drive | Motivation | Inner drive that energizes action toward goals. | Rooted in Self-Determination Theory as the energizing force encompassing intrinsic and autonomous forms supported by satisfaction of autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs. |
| Drive | Self-Discipline | Maintains consistent routines and self-control. | The ability to suppress prepotent responses for higher goals with emphasis on long-term consistency and dedication, empirically distinct from momentary self-control. |
| Drive | Perseverance | Keeps going despite obstacles, setbacks, or fatigue. | Defined as grit—trait-level perseverance and passion for long-term goals—that predicts retention and performance in demanding contexts when controlling for self-control. |
| Drive | Vitality | Approaches tasks with energy, enthusiasm, and stamina. | Subjective vitality reflecting positive feeling of aliveness and energy available to the self as aspect of eudaimonic well-being, distinct from goal-directed motivation. |
| Drive | Focus | Sustains attention on priorities without distraction. | Sustained attention involving three distinct cognitive control functions (monitoring, energization, inhibition) with different developmental patterns than attentional selectivity. |
| Stability | Composure | Remaining calm and steady under stress or pressure. | One of six resilience domains involving emotional regulation that maintains calm demeanor through recognition of emotions without allowing them to overwhelm actions. |
| Stability | Tolerance | Accepts differences and endures discomfort without hostility. | A fair, objective attitude representing intermediate position between acceptance and opposition involving endurance of difference without hostile interference. |
| Stability | Adaptability | Adjusts behavior to function effectively in new conditions. | Proactive behavioral adjustment to function effectively amidst change without necessarily involving adversity, distinguishing it from resilience's reactive recovery from stress. |
| Stability | Optimism | Expects favorable outcomes and looks for opportunities. | A resilience-conducive trait involving expectations of favorable outcomes and active engagement of adaptive coping strategies applicable to situations amenable to planning. |
| Stability | Resilience | Recovers quickly and grows from stress or loss. | Ability to persevere and bounce back involving emotional intelligence to harness feelings for coping, uniquely searching for meaning in circumstances not amenable to planning. |
| Stability | Self-Regulation | Controls impulses and emotions to stay aligned with values. | The broadest regulatory construct encompassing processes to maintain cognitions, emotions, and behaviors toward goals by reducing intensity of impulses through stress management. |
| Connection | Kindness | Shows warmth through small, everyday prosocial acts. | Small, supererogatory prosocial acts performed for practical reasons without necessarily involving deep emotional resonance, distinct from compassion's emotional concern. |
| Connection | Empathy | Understands and shares the feelings of others. | Encompasses cognitive and emotional empathy serving as prerequisite for compassion but not requiring action, empirically distinct from sympathy's pity-based response. |
| Connection | Forgiveness | Lets go of resentment and offers second chances. | Involves decisional forgiveness (behavioral intention) and emotional forgiveness (replacement of negative emotions) through validated four-phase process improving well-being. |
| Connection | Caring | Provides sustained support and concern for others' well-being. | Sustained concern and support over time involving commitment through continued attention, distinct from empathy's momentary resonance or kindness's discrete acts. |
| Connection | Gratitude | Appreciates and acknowledges what others contribute. | An emotion, attitude, and trait that significantly predicts psychological well-being, prosocial tendency, and resilience through the broaden-and-build mechanism. |
| Connection | Justice | Acts to ensure fairness and equal treatment in groups. | Moral reasoning concerned with fairness through equality (impartial regard) and reciprocity (personal merit), emphasizing cooperative organization based on abstract fairness principles. |
| Influence | Leadership | Guides and motivates others toward shared goals. | An influence process grounded in shared group membership binding leaders and followers, proven by followership and involving motivation toward collective goals. |
| Influence | Communication | Expresses ideas clearly and appropriately. | Two-way transfer of information requiring communicator and receiver, involving conversation rule-following and distinguished from expression by bidirectional, collective nature. |
| Influence | Self-Confidence | Believes in one's ability to succeed. | A broader trait reflecting overall belief in competence that is nonspecific and general rather than task-specific, distinguishing it from self-efficacy and assertiveness. |
| Influence | Initiative | Takes proactive action without waiting for direction. | Personal initiative representing self-starting, future-oriented behavior to improve situations, with meta-analyses showing associations with job performance and career success. |
| Influence | Assertiveness | Stands up for one's own needs, rights, or views directly and respectfully. | Ability to communicate emotions and wants without infringing others' rights, requiring healthy boundaries through effective communication as behavioral skill. |
| Influence | Influence | Persuades and shapes decisions or attitudes. | The process where emotions, opinions, or behaviors are affected by others through persuasion, serving as mechanism through which leadership operates. |

The table above contains all 36 facets in canonical order. Definitions are precise, behaviorally anchored, and written to avoid cross-loading.

### 3.3 Design principles to be validated

1. Each facet measures a single construct.
2. Facets within a domain are related yet non-overlapping.
3. Facets across domains do not overlap in meaning.
4. Facet definitions are population-appropriate for general adults and can be adapted for lower literacy or trauma-sensitive contexts without changing the construct.

## 4. Expert panel composition

Recruit 8-12 experts across three profiles:

1. **Psychometricians and measurement scientists**
   - 1-3 experts who can evaluate dimensionality risks and standards.
2. **Domain psychologists and applied behavioral scientists**
   - 3-6 experts in personality, counseling, organizational behavior, education, or workforce development.
3. **Applied practitioners for use realism**
   - 2-3 experienced coaches, counselors, or workforce program leads who can judge real-world meaning and clarity.

Optional members include a trauma-informed care specialist and a DEI specialist.

Provide a modest honorarium per expert. Track conflicts of interest and affiliations.

## 5. Instruments for expert judgment

All instruments are delivered via an online survey system. Use consistent scales and provide definitions and examples on page one of the survey.

### 5.1 Domain clarity instrument

For each domain, experts rate:

1. **Conceptual clarity** of the domain definition (1-4 scale):
   - `1` = Not clear
   - `2` = Somewhat clear
   - `3` = Clear
   - `4` = Very clear
2. **Distinctness** from the other five domains (`1-4`)
3. **Sufficiency** of domain coverage of strengths (`1-4`)
4. **Open comment field** for suggestions

> **Decision rule suggestions:**
>
> - Mean clarity at least `3.2` across experts
> - Fewer than 20% of experts rating `2` or below on distinctness
> - Qualitative comments show no unresolved conceptual conflicts

### 5.2 Facet clarity instrument

For each facet, experts rate:

1. **Single construct focus** (`1-4`)
2. **Clarity of the definition** (`1-4`)
3. **Behavioral anchoring** (`1-4`)
4. **Label appropriateness** (`1-4`)
5. **Appropriateness for intended populations** (`1-4`)
6. **Open comment field** for rewrite suggestions

> **Decision rule suggestions:**
>
> - Mean for items 1-4 at least `3.0`
> - No more than 2 experts rating `2` or below on any one criterion
> - Item Content Validity Index (I-CVI) at least `0.78` when the panel has 6+ experts
>
> **Notes on content validity indices:**
>
> - **Item Content Validity Index (I-CVI)** counts the proportion of experts who mark a facet as clear and essential. Treat ratings of `3` or `4` as agreement on essentiality.
> - **Scale Content Validity Index Average (S-CVI/Ave)** is the mean of the item indices across all facets.

### 5.3 Cross-loading matrix instrument

Experts rate the expected relation of each facet to each domain using a 4-point scale:

- `0` = No relation
- `1` = Slight relation
- `2` = Moderate relation
- `3` = Strong relation

Each facet should show strong relation to its intended domain and zero or slight relation to other domains. Use a heatmap in analysis.

> **Decision rule suggestions:**
>
> - For each facet, the intended domain rating mean at least `2.5`
> - No other domain mean above `1.0` for that facet
> - No more than 25% of experts giving a moderate relation to any non-intended domain

### 5.4 Coverage sufficiency instrument

Panel answers global questions:

1. Do the 36 facets adequately cover the space of personal strengths for general adult use?
2. Are there important constructs missing?
3. Are any facets redundant at the conceptual level?

### 5.5 Language sensitivity and accessibility checklist

Experts review definitions for:

1. Reading level at or below grade 8 when adapted
2. Trauma-sensitive phrasing and avoidance of triggering language
3. Cultural fairness in examples and wording
4. Avoidance of clinical labeling unless the context requires it

## 6. Procedures

### 6.1 Preparation

1. Finalize the domain and facet table with draft definitions and rationales.
2. Prepare a short overview deck that explains the project vision, use cases, and populations.
3. Load the instruments into the survey system and test with an internal pilot of 2-3 readers.

### 6.2 Recruitment

1. Identify candidates across the three profiles and invite via email with a one-page brief and consent language.
2. Offer an honorarium and a two-week response window.
3. Schedule an optional one-hour live orientation for questions.

### 6.3 Data collection

1. Keep the survey open for 10-14 days.
2. Send reminders at day 5 and day 10.
3. Provide a help contact for clarifications.

### 6.4 Synthesis workshop

1. Convene a two-hour workshop with a subset of experts to resolve contested facets and domain issues.
2. Capture decisions in a revision log.

### 6.5 Revision and confirmation

1. Update definitions based on decisions.
2. Circulate the revised model for quick confirmation sign-off.

## 7. Analysis plan

### 7.1 Agreement statistics

Compute the following for transparency and rigor:

1. **Item Content Validity Index (I-CVI)** for each facet
   - Proportion of experts who marked the facet as essential and clear
   - Minimum acceptance threshold `0.78` for panels with 6+ experts
2. **Scale Content Validity Index Average (S-CVI/Ave)**
   - Mean of item indices across all facets
   - Target at least `0.90`
3. **Content Validity Ratio (CVR)** for critical yes/no items
   - Formula uses count of essential votes and panel size
   - Use when you include a direct "essential" question
4. **Inter-rater agreement** on clarity ratings
   - Report percent agreement and a chance-corrected coefficient for ordinal data when feasible

### 7.2 Cross-loading analysis

1. Produce a facet-by-domain heatmap from the cross-loading matrix.
2. Flag any facet where a non-intended domain mean exceeds `1.0`.
3. List top 3 at-risk pairs for discussion in the workshop.

### 7.3 Qualitative analysis

1. Code comments into themes: rewrite, relabel, merge, split, relocate domain, remove, add new facet, language accessibility.
2. Summarize by facet and by domain with exemplar quotes.

### 7.4 Decision rules and actions

For each facet and domain, apply the rules below:

- **Accept as is** when all thresholds are met and no significant cross-loading
- **Revise language** when clarity is below thresholds but cross-loading is not present
- **Reassign domain** when intended domain alignment fails but cross-loading shows a clear alternate
- **Merge or split** when redundancy or over-breadth is identified by the panel
- **Remove** when essentiality is not supported and coverage remains adequate without it

All actions are recorded in the revision log with the evidence that motivated the change.

## 8. Deliverables

1. Construct validation packet used with experts
2. De-identified expert responses dataset
3. Analysis workbook with indices, heatmaps, and summaries
4. Revision log and decision record
5. Final domain and facet definitions v1 with change annotations
6. Public-facing summary suitable for funders and partners

## 9. Timeline

A practical timeline for an initial cycle is shown below. Weeks are calendar weeks.

| Week | Activity |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Finalize packet and survey instruments, recruit experts |
| 2 | Survey live, orientation session |
| 3 | Survey continues, reminders sent |
| 4 | Close survey, run analysis, prepare workshop materials |
| 5 | Conduct synthesis workshop, draft revisions |
| 6 | Circulate revised model for confirmation, finalize report |

This can be accelerated to 3-4 weeks with tight coordination.

## 10. Roles and responsibilities

1. **Study lead**
   - Owns schedule, communications, and quality control
2. **Psychometric advisor**
   - Reviews instruments and analysis methods
   - Facilitates the synthesis workshop
3. **Domain owners**
   - Provide initial definitions and rationales
   - Implement agreed revisions
4. **Project coordinator**
   - Manages survey, expert roster, and honoraria

## 11. Ethics, consent, and data handling

1. Provide written consent language describing purpose, expected time, honorarium, confidentiality, and data use.
2. De-identify all responses before analysis and sharing.
3. Store raw data in a secure location with access controls.
4. If partnering with a university, seek guidance on whether the activity is considered research that requires review. Expert judgment on construct definitions is often considered consultation rather than human subjects research.

## 12. Risks and mitigation

1. **Low expert response rate**
   - Recruit more than needed and provide clear honoraria and deadlines
2. **Conflicting expert opinions**
   - Use the synthesis workshop with structured decision rules
3. **Scope creep into item-level debates**
   - Keep the focus on constructs and definitions in this phase
4. **Language accessibility concerns**
   - Include a specialist in readability and trauma-informed communication in the panel
